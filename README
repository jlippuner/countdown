This is a simple count down clock where the background
changes from green to yellow (when warn 1 time is
remaining) and finally to red (when warn 2 time is
remaining).

The count down is controlled with keyboard short cuts:

[space] start/pause/resume count down

[r]     reset count down when paused or finished

[c]     change the total time and warn 1/2 times when
        count down is reset
